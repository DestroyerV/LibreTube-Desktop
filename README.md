 üìíAbout
</h2>

YouTube has an extremely invasive [privacy policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10364219) which relies on using user data in unethical ways. They store a lot of your personal data - ranging from ideas, music taste, content, political opinions, and much more than you think.

This project is aimed at improving the users' privacy by being independent from Google and bypassing their data collection.

Therefore, the app is using the [Piped API](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped), which uses proxies to circumvent Google's data collection and includes some other additional features.
